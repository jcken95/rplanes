Description: The 'rplanes' package provides functionality to prepare data
    and and analyze plausibility of both forecasted and reported
    epidemiological signals. The functions implement a set of plausbility
    algorithms that are agnostic to geographic and time resolutions and
    are calculated independently then presented as a combined score.
