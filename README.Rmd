> **DEVELOPMENT STATUS**: The `rplanes` package is being actively developed. As of v0.0.2 the package is under alpha release. Users should be aware that there may be significant changes to the API in this phase.

## Introduction

The `rplanes` package (**pl**ausibility **an**alysis of **e**pidemiological **s**ignals) provides functionality to prepare data and analyze plausibility of both forecasted and reported epidemiological signals. The functions implement a set of plausibility algorithms that are agnostic to geographic and time resolutions and are calculated independently and then presented as a combined score. 


## Installation

``` r
#install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("signaturescience/rplanes", build_vignettes=TRUE)
```
