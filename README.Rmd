## Introduction

The 'rplanes' package (**pl**ausibility **an**alysis of **e**pidemiological **s**ignals) provides functionality to prepare data and analyze plausibility of both forecasted and reported epidemiological signals. The functions implement a set of plausbility algorithms that are agnostic to geographic and time resolutions and are calculated independently and then presented as a combined score. 


## Installation

``` r
#install.pacakges("remotes")
remotes::install_github("signaturescience/rplanes")
```

## Getting Started

Check out under Articles above for the Basic Usage on how to format the data sets. This article also provides example data on how to run the different planes components.
