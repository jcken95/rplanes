## Data

The **observed data** uploaded must be in a .csv format.

The columns contain:

-   date: Is the date of the reported value in date class format.

-   The epiyear and epiweek is optional but can be obtained from the date column using `lubridate::epiyear()` for the epiyear and `MMWRweek::MMWRweek()` for the epiweek.

-   location must be in geographic unit such as [FIPS code](https://www.bls.gov/respondents/mwr/electronic-data-interchange/appendix-d-usps-state-abbreviations-and-fips-codes.htm).

-   An outcome column, in this example is called flu.admits, representing hospital flu admissions.

```{r}
#| echo: false
data_1 = read.csv(system.file("extdata/observed", "hdgov_hosp_weekly.csv", package = "rplanes")) %>% 
  slice_sample(n=5)

knitr::kable(data_1, align = c("lllll"))
```

The **forecast data** must also be a .csv file with the following columns labeled explicitly as:

-   forecast_date: The date the forecast was generated.

-   target: The horizon for the forecast, in the example it is a weekly horizon with a number for 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks ahead.

-   target_end_date: The date of the expected forecast horizon in date class format.

-   location: In geographic unit such as [FIPS code](https://www.bls.gov/respondents/mwr/electronic-data-interchange/appendix-d-usps-state-abbreviations-and-fips-codes.htm), in character format.

-   type: The type of predicted value as a point value or quantile value. Can contain quantile only but not point only.

-   quantile: The quantile in numeric format.

-   value: The predicted outcome value for the forecast in numeric format.

```{r}
#| echo: false
set.seed(100)
data_2 = read.csv(system.file("extdata/forecast", "2023-02-06-SigSci-TSENS.csv", package = "rplanes")) %>%
  slice_sample(n=10)
knitr::kable(data_2, align = c("lllllll"))
```
