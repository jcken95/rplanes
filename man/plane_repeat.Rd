\usage{
plane_repeat(input, location, k = 3, seed)
}
\arguments{
\item{input}{Input signal data to be scored; object must be one of \link[=to_signal]{forecast}}

\item{location}{Character vector with location code; the location must appear in input and seed}

\item{k}{Threshold for the number of repeats to be flagged. Default is 3.}

\item{seed}{Prepared \link[=plane_seed]{seed}}
}
\value{
A \code{list} with the following values:
\itemize{
\item \strong{indicator}: Logical as to whether or not the value is repeated sequentially k number of times.
}

If the \strong{indicator} returns TRUE the additional values returned:
\itemize{
\item \strong{dates}: The dates at which the consecutively repeated values occur.
}
}
\description{
This function evaluates whether consecutive values in observations or forecasts are repeated a k number of times. This function takes in a \link[=to_signal]{forecast} object that is either from an observed dataset or forecast dataset.
