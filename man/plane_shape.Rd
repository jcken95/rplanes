\usage{
plane_shape(location, input, seed)
}
\arguments{
\item{location}{Character vector with location code; the location must appear in input and seed}

\item{input}{Input signal data to be scored; object must be one of \link[=to_signal]{forecast} or \link[=to_signal]{observed}}

\item{seed}{Prepared \link[=plane_seed]{seed}}

\itemize{
\item \strong{indicator}: Logical as to whether or not the shape of the evaluated signal is novel
\item \strong{output}: An n x 5 tibble. The columns are:
\itemize{
\item \strong{date}: The dates corresponding to all observed and forecast data (formatted as date)
\item \strong{point}: The incidence of all observed and forecast data (e.g., hospitalization rates)
\item \strong{type}: Indicates whether the data row is observed or forecast data
